## Research interests

#### Soil-plant-Atmosphere interaction 🌱🌳🌤️💧


Since the end of my phd in 2015, my research interests mainly focus on improving our understanding of the role of the roots in regulating water in the {term}`SPAC` using experimental non-destructive approaches (see {numref}`rhizo_neons`).

#### Geohazards ⛰🌊🏜️

I also like to solve other typical geophysical problematic such as geohazard assessment (landslide monitoring, landfill leakage detection). 
Field work is a great opportunity to make some sport and change its point of view (see {numref}`valfredda`)

#### FAIR and reproducible research 🚀🎉

Finally, I'm really enthusiastic with all the splendid initiatives and tools towards a more . I'm trying to join the movement building reproducible research (see {numref}`logoCAGS`).

SPAC
  The soil-plant-atmosphere continuum (SPAC) is the pathway for water moving from soil through plants to the atmosphere. (source wikipedia)

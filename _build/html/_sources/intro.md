# My career book in a nutshell

Hello my name is Benjamin. I'm a Marie-Curie fellow interested in geophysics applied to agronomy. I like to develop open-source tools for open and reproducible science in agrogeophysic.


```{admonition} Why an interactive book?
:class: tip
This book is a compilation of my early career work as a geophysicist in academia. I thought my research would be more FAIRly illustrated/evaluating using an interactive book. And I ❤️ the [Jupyter-book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) initiative so it was a good opportunity to learn how to use it! Hope you have fun reading it!

I consider an important step in my early career occured after moving towards **Open Science**. This change of perspective has been triggered while I was working on my [Marie-Curie fellowship](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/842922), remotely from France during the Covid-19 pandemic and I needed access to data. I investigate how we can produce more FAIR data in geophysics and found very inspiring people paving the way.

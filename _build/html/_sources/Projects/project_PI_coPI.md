Position (uphill, downhill) and length of the sections should be adapted according to the resolution needed and the
expected variability intra and inter-treatments. Note that the sharpening of EO data (D1.5) would allow to get a
footprint close to each treatment size.

### Abstract

The **GRwater project** (_GRwater path starts here: multi-scale monitoring the Earth Critical Zone a key, missing parameter for assessing the forest post-fire management in the face of global
warming_) tackles the growing interest in understanding the fate of water in forest and post-fire management in the Spanish region.

GRwater project aims to enhance forest management to restore the water cycle while mitigating socio-environmental and environmental risks associated. It aligns with trends in sustainable
ecosystems and water resource preservation. The project has a particular focus on field sites with high ecological values located in Castilla-La Mancha (CLM) region affected by fires in the recent
years. It investigates different forest restoration methods, including varying tree densities, as well as mulching and physical barriers. To date, there is limited empirical support for the efficacy of
these management strategies in reinstating the water cycle to promote vegetation health and erosion prevention, despite substantial financial investment.
GRwater uniquely integrates **hydrogeophysics** with **Remote Sensing (RS)** to assess the **Earth‚Äôs Critical Zone (ECZ)** comprehensively. 

The project will prioritize developing an efficient survey technique, including automatic geophysics, to improve data collection for monitoring subsurface water dynamics. Additionally, GRwater aims to enhance our modeling capabilities using energy and water balance models‚Äô, to provide better predictions on plant water availability and groundwater recharge and flow. Machine learning and data assimilation techniques are explored to incorporate
the hydrogeophysical data.

GRwater collaborates with partners to manage fire-affected field sites, facilitating access to eco-socio-hydrological data and models for stakeholders and researchers. It aims to address transboundary catchment issues in water management, applicable in other Spanish locations.

### Abstract

Water scarcity is the biggest threat to world food production. A third of water use in Europe goes to the agricultural sector but many regions, especially in the south, are still going thirsty. The EU-funded project GROWING is working with farmers, academics and stakeholders in the private sector to develop practical new tools and services for arboriculture, viticulture and agronomy. Its solution is based on an advanced plant root phenotyping technology, above- and below-ground monitoring system and a data assimilation scheme to construct a model of water distribution.

##### Abstract

The project aims to develop, test and consolidate an operational protocol aimed at reducing water consumption for the irrigation of high value-added crops, typical of the Mediterranean region, with important socio-economic consequences for current and future scenarios of possible scarcity of water resources. The protocol is defined through a combination of scientific, technical and training activities conducted by nine partners distributed in the Mediterranean basin.

The aim of the project is therefore to build, refine and disseminate technical skills in irrigation management that specifically address the needs of the Euro-Mediterranean region. These skills must be able to be introduced and maintained in arid or semi-arid agricultural production areas, and must be based on simple but physically robust models of water use, and on inexpensive but reliable methodologies for monitoring soil moisture and state of crops.

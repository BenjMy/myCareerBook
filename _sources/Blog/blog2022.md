### Nice reading about Machine learning and Geosciences

I wanted to catch up a little bit and read about possible applications of _Machine Learning for Geosciences_. The most difficult was to find an entry point among the huge litterature and courses available. I started with the introduction to deep learning with the [UC Berkeley open course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_iWQOsE6TfVmKkQHucjPAoRtIJYt8a5A) and listened to two great talks from at [Software Underground](https://softwareunderground.org/). 

- [Self supervised noise suppression of seismic data](https://transform.softwareunderground.org/2022-self-supervised-noise-suppression) by C. Birnie and S. Liu;
- [Geospatial ML challenges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4YvnLMzYDc) by T. Ostersen and T. Carmichael. 


```{admonition} My position
:class: tip
I feel like the spectra of ML for geophysical is huge but I'm still to unmature to start a project from scratch! Looking for opportunities to contribute.
- Processing metadata [Open-source Tension-disk Infiltrometer Meta-Database](https://github.com/climasoma/otim-db) with ML could be a great start isnt it?

### First time as a reviewer for the **Journal of Open Source Software**

I was asked to review for the [JOSS](https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/4620#issue-1321005781)! Not only I learned how to publish quality research software but also what **Tessellation** is i.e "discretization of space into subspaces without overlaps and gaps". 

Find out more in the [tesspy Github repo](https://github.com/siavash-saki/tesspy).

```{admonition} My turn
:class: tip
Thanks to this experience I plan now to tentatively publish in [JOSS](https://joss.theoj.org/about) the [ICSD code](Open_Codes/open_codes.html#ICSD). Work in progress.

### Starting the new year with the **Ram√≥n y Cajal** application

Applying to grants is a fantastic way to learn about important our **peers** that made history of Science. 

In 2019, I was awarded a **Maria Sk≈Çodowska Curie** fellowship for the [Growing project](Projects/Award_Grants/grant). As a French and because I studied my Master degree to the University Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC), I obviously knew her extraordinary trajectory work and life.

One reading recommandation to get a passionate and deep taste of her life is "La rid√≠cula idea de no volver a verte" de Rosa Montero (ISBN: 9788432222719).

```
In 2022, I sent an application to the **Ram√≥n y Cajal**. Entonces **Ram√≥n y Cajal** quien eres?
Make no mistake, it's one unique person (at first I was confused due to the 'y') who certainly accomplished the work of two... Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal (1852-1934), was a Spanish physician and scientific and is considered as the father of neuroscience and once an aspiring artist.

Unfortunately I can't comment on figure {numref}`nerve cells_in_the_brain`, I'm just admiring the patience he had to accomplish it.

```{admonition} Edit
:class: important
In the meantime I received the response and ranked >100 which if far from succesfull. 
 - "Sin embargo, su producci√≥n cient√≠fica es relativamente limitada"
 - "La experiencia en la supervisi√≥n de estudiantes es relativamente limitada". 
 
Thanks all who help me to prepare the application (V. Hevia Mart√≠n). **Ram√≥n y Cajal** See you next year!

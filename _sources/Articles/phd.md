### Abtract

I worked during my Phd on the [Ot-med program](https://www.otmed.fr/). The research of Ot-Med is focused on global change and natural hazards in the Mediterranean basin. One of the aim is to identify and evaluate innovative strategies to help decision-makers in elaborating public policies in treating environmental questions.

My research examines the impacts of tree roots developpement on dike safety, and strategies that stakeholders may adopt to reduce negative impacts. I do this by combining electrical and acoustical tomography analyses to image soil spatial hetegerogeneities and map tree roots system.

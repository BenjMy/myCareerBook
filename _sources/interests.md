## Research interests

### Soil-plant-Atmosphere interaction 🌱🌳🌤️💧


Since the end of my phd in 2015, my research interests mainly focus on improving our understanding of the role of the roots in regulating water in the {term}`SPAC` using experimental non-destructive approaches (see {numref}`rhizo_neons`).

I contributed to 2 main projects: 


- [GROWING](Projects/Award_Grants/grant): Geophysical Roots Obervations for Water SavING
- [WASA](Projects/project_list.html#WASA (🗓️ 2016 - 2019)): Water Saving in Agriculture  (2016 - 2019)
- and [others](Projects/projects)

### Geohazards ⛰🌊🏜️

I also like to solve other typical geophysical problematic such as geohazard assessment (landslide monitoring, landfill leakage detection). 
Field work is a great opportunity to make some sport and change its point of view (see {numref}`valfredda`)

### FAIR and reproducible research 🚀🎉

Finally, I'm really enthusiastic with all the splendid initiatives and tools towards a more . I'm trying to join the movement building reproducible research (see {numref}`logoCAGS`).

I contributed to [open source codes](Open_Codes/open_codes)

SPAC
  The soil-plant-atmosphere continuum (SPAC) is the pathway for water moving from soil through plants to the atmosphere. (source wikipedia)

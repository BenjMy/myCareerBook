## Soil-plant-Atmosphere interactions 🌱🌳🌤️💧

### Refining ET estimates and WUE
In 2023, I became a part of the Tech4Agro team, where my role involves connecting geophysics with remote sensing (RS). I concentrate on root zone soil moisture, specifically delving into the possibilities of utilizing electrical conductivity to enhance evapotranspiration estimates. 

I contributed to 2 projects: 
- [EO4WUE](Projects/project_list_others.html#EO4WUE (🗓️ 2023-2024)): Earth observation tools for the evaluation and management of water efficiency and productivity in Mediterranean grasslands and cereal crops
- [EOMAJI](Projects/project_list_others.html#EO AFRICA EO-MAJI (🗓️ 2023-2024)): Earth Observation system to Manage Africa’s food systems by Joint-knowledge of crop production and Irrigation digitization



### Agronomy
Since the end of my phd in 2015, my research interests mainly focus on improving our understanding of the role of the roots in regulating water in the {term}`SPAC` using experimental non-destructive approaches (see {numref}`rhizo_neons`).

I contributed to 3 projects: 
- [GROWING](Projects/Award_Grants/grant): Geophysical Roots Obervations for Water SavING
- [WASA](Projects/project_list.html#WASA (🗓️ 2016 - 2019)): Water Saving in Agriculture  (2016 - 2019)
- [ROOTS](Projects/project_list_others.html#ROOTS (🗓️ 2021 - Now)):  Rhizosphere Observations Optimizing Terrestrial Sequestration
- [SoCoRisk](Projects/project_list_others.html#SoCoRisk (🗓️ 01/03/2021 - 28/02/2024)) : Implementation of soil compaction risk assessment system – end-user’s evaluation of potentials and barriers

### Earth Critical Zone Hydrology

- [ECZ-DRY](Projects/project_list_others.html#ECZ-DRY (🗓️ 2019 - Now)): New Technologies to monitor the earth critical zone in water-limited ecosystems
- [WATSON](Projects/project_list_others.html#WATSON (🗓️ 09/2022 - 09/2024)) : WATer isotopeS in the critical zONe: from groundwater recharge to plant transpiration


## Geohazards ⛰🌊🏜️

I also like to solve other typical geophysical problematic such as geohazard assessment (landslide monitoring, landfill leakage detection). 
Field work is a great opportunity to make some sport and change its point of view (see {numref}`valfredda`)

## FAIR and reproducible research 🚀🎉

Finally, I'm really enthusiastic with all the splendid initiatives and tools towards a more . I'm trying to join the movement building reproducible research (see {numref}`logoCAGS`).

I contributed to [open source codes](Open_Codes/open_codes)

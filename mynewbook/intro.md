# My career book in a nutshell

This book is a compilation of my early career work as a geophysicist in academia. Indeed, I thought my research would be better illustrated using an interactive book especially after considering that an important step in my early career occured when I move towards **Open Science**. 
This change of perspective has been triggered while I was working on my Marie-Curie fellowship remotely from France during the Covid-19 pandemic and I needed access to data. I had the chance that colleagues from the department could maintain the laboratory experiment in order to collect some, but I investigate how we can produce more FAIR data in geophysics and found very inspiring people paving the way. 


The [CV](CV/cv_details) section give an overview of my contributions in terms of article, teaching and public outreach engagement. The [Open codes](Open_Codes/open_codes) section show interactive example of the main codes I'm routinely and actively developing. Finally, the [blog](Blog/blog) section highlights moments of my research covering different topics such as field acquisition, new code development, project milestone etc...

## Research interests

#### Soil-plant-Atmosphere interaction 🌱🌳🌤️💧


Since the end of my phd in 2015, my research interests mainly focus on improving our understanding of the role of the roots in regulating water in the {term}`SPAC` using experimental non-destructive approaches (see {numref}`rhizo_neons`)
.

#### Geohazards ⛰🌊🏜️

I also like to solve other typical geophysical problematic such as geohazard assessment (landslide monitoring, landfill leakage detection). 
Field work is a great opportunity to make some sport and change its point of view (see {numref}`valfredda`)

#### FAIR and reproducible research 🚀🎉

Finally, I'm really enthusiastic with all the splendid initiatives and tools towards a more . I'm trying to join the movement building reproducible research (see {numref}`logoCAGS`).

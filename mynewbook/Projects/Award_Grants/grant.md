[GROWING](https://benjmy.github.io/Growing.github.io/): Geophysical Roots Observations for Water savING
	- **PI**: Benjamin Mary
	- Goal: develop our capability of understanding, through measuring and modeling, the actions of the root system on water state and fluxes in the soil-plant-atmosphere system.
	- Consortium: UNIPD/LBLN

### Abstract

Water scarcity is the biggest threat to world food production. A third of water use in Europe goes to the agricultural sector but many regions, especially in the south, are still going thirsty. The EU-funded project GROWING is working with farmers, academics and stakeholders in the private sector to develop practical new tools and services for arboriculture, viticulture and agronomy. Its solution is based on an advanced plant root phenotyping technology, above- and below-ground monitoring system and a data assimilation scheme to construct a model of water distribution.

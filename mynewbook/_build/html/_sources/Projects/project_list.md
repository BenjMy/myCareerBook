#### Abtract

The project aims to develop, test and consolidate an operational protocol aimed at reducing water consumption for the irrigation of high value-added crops, typical of the Mediterranean region, with important socio-economic consequences for current and future scenarios of possible scarcity of water resources. The protocol is defined through a combination of scientific, technical and training activities conducted by nine partners distributed in the Mediterranean basin.

The aim of the project is therefore to build, refine and disseminate technical skills in irrigation management that specifically address the needs of the Euro-Mediterranean region. These skills must be able to be introduced and maintained in arid or semi-arid agricultural production areas, and must be based on simple but physically robust models of water use, and on inexpensive but reliable methodologies for monitoring soil moisture and state of crops.
